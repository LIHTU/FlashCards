Robin Nelson

## The purposes of this app
1. Allow me to experiment with vue.js and learn the basic of this framework.
2. To serve a basic demo of front end web development skills to prospective employers.

I'm traditionally a AngularJS devloper, but am enjoying the vue's intuitive design.

## Instructions to Run
1. download or clone the repo
2. open index.html or another html file locally.  


## ABOUT
New data not persistent! This app has no backend and does not current leverage browser caching to implement any level of persistence.
I'm currently working on the backend in another repo, using django and deploying on the google cloud platform, 
but both of these technologies are new to me, so launch date on the served version of the app is unknown.
Hopefully, I'll have it up by November 20th, 2019
