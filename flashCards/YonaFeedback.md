Overall it looks and feels good. The code is pretty readable, but I have some suggestions for neatness and clarity:
- Update project name, page title, README to reflect the name of your project: "Card Tree"
- Remove old Vue starter app stuff, e.g. HelloWorld.vue
- Maybe remove "Manage Sets" link since it doesn't do anything
- Be consistent in using single vs double quotes
- Clean up javascript -- remove commented-out code, that's what git is for
- "stopProp" utility function should probly go away -- just call the method itself :)
- use ES6-style javascript consistently:
- () => {} instead of function() {}
- const/let isntead of var
- === instead of ==
- CSS is a bit hard to read
- Try using SMACSS or another similar CSS module convention
- Maybe refactor a bit for clarity. The "row" class seems to be a grid, for example
- Use SCSS or LESS and nest your classes well.
- Maybe try using `display: grid` for your grid -- it's new and powerful and sexy
- Bonus would be to use TypeScript :)
